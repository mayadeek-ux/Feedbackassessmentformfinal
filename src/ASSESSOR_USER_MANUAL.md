- **Observing Dynamics:** Pay attention to how the team works together

---

## Scoring Methodology

### The Tick-Box System

**Philosophy:**
- Simple, objective, and fast
- Each behavior/capability is binary: observed or not observed
- Reduces subjective bias
- Easy to explain and defend

**How It Works:**
1. Read each sub-criterion carefully
2. Ask yourself: "Did I observe this during the assessment?"
3. If YES: Tick the box ✅
4. If NO or UNCLEAR: Leave unticked ❌
5. Scores accumulate automatically

### Performance Bands

**Understanding the Bands:**

| Score Range | Band | Meaning | Development Focus |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------------|
| **80-100** | Exceptional 🟢 | Outstanding performance, exceeds expectations | Leadership roles, mentoring others |
| **60-79** | Strong 🔵 | Solid competence, meets expectations | Refinement, advanced skills |
| **40-59** | Developing 🟡 | Growing capabilities, has potential | Targeted training, practice opportunities |
| **0-39** | Limited 🔴 | Foundation building needed | Intensive support, basic skill development |

### Calibration Tips

**Consistency Across Assessments:**
- Use the same standards for all candidates
- Don't inflate scores to "be nice"—honest feedback helps development
- If uncertain about a sub-criterion, leave it unticked
- Consult with fellow assessors if you need calibration

**Avoiding Biases:**
- **Halo Effect:** Don't let one strong area inflate all scores
- **Recency Bias:** Consider the entire session, not just the end
- **Contrast Effect:** Don't compare candidates to each other
- **First Impression:** Give candidates the full assessment period
